# Design

Design goals:

- Users can build and customize in the world in many ways, there are only few restrictions (like environmental objects that must be demolished before the area can be customized).
- Visitors occupy the camp site for a temporary period (which is the main difference to other city builders, where residents are supposed to stay for as long as possible). Main tasks of the player includes:
  - Making the site attractive so that visitors consider staying at the site in the first place
  - Making the stay pleasant so that visitors are happy, spend more money, and are more likely to visit again in the future (though repeating customers are mostly simulated)
  - Making the site attractive to certain groups of visitors, some of which have distinct requirements for a good stay. The player has the option of choosing to only focus on one or a few groups, which would still make a successful site.
- Day-to-day tasks on the camp site are carried out by various employees, and the player is focused not on giving those employees tasks, but:
  - Making sure that enough workforce exists to deal with tasks of various types
  - Making sure that employees are happy (which makes it easier to employ more people)
  - "Upgrading" employees by training them into specialized roles that are more efficient at certain tasks
- There is utility management (water, electricity, garbage, etc.), but it's more basic than in most city builders in that most of the supply is external. The player is mostly tasked with properly connecting all places that require utilities, and not so much managing the supply of the utilities.

Basic gameplay loop is like any other micro-management game in the broad "city builder" genre:

- spend funds to construct a camping site that is attractive to visitors
- visitors arrive and are happy about their stay, providing you with funds
- spend the newly acquired funds to make the site even more attractive to visitors
- repeat

## Style

The world art style is a very low resolution (8-bit era) full color (16-bit era) pixel art look with coarse animations. The UI art style will be a relatively clean but rustic look (paper sheets, wood panels, typewriter documents and traditionally printed texts in sans-serif fonts).
